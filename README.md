# Herbaceous SPV

Herbaceous SPV is the Single Player Variant of Steve Finn, Eduardo Baraf, and Beth Sobel's 2017 flavorful Herbaceous board game. The single player rules have been developped by Keith Matejka. 

This is a fan project to see if I could replicate the Herbaceous mechanics/engine in Python. Although it is not perfect, it should run on linux and Mac with Python 3.6. It only uses command line options.

If any of the game creators or Pencil First Games have any issues with this project. I will gladly remove it from my page. This was not made for monetary reasons (as it is on github) but only as a fun side-project.

## Rules

### Initial setup
36 cards are kept from the original 72 deck for a playthrough. 
* 1 card is drawn to create the discard pile
* 2 cards are placed into the Community Garden
* 3 cards are placed into the Private Garden

### Plant step
Three cards are drawn from the deck. Each card is drawn one at a time, and deciding where to place each card. In any order:
* Private Garden
* Community Garden
* Discard pile
The same location cannot be selected twice in the same set of 3 cards

### Containers
There are 4 different containers in which you may pot herbs in. 
* Large pot: All the herbs in this container must be of the same type (1 to 7 herbs)
* Wooden planter: All the herbs in this container must be uniquer (1 to 7 herbs)
* Small pots: The herbs must be potted in pairs. Each pair must be different from the other (2 to 12 herbs)
* Glass jars: Any 3 herbs can be potted into this container. It may contain special herbs for bonus points.

### Special rules
If at any time, a 5th card is added to the Community Garden, discard all cards from the Community Garden into the Discard Pile.

During the first turn, it is possible to pot any herbs if desired.

### Game end
The game can end in 2 ways:
* There are no available containers to pot herbs
* There is no more cards to draw. You are then given one last chance to pot any remaining herbs.
